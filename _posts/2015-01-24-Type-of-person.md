Mình đang đọc cuốn Java for Dummies, 6th Edition, thấy có đoạn này tác giả viết thiệt hay, và hơn nữa cũng muốn test site này nên dịch ra và quăng lên...

Now the time has come for you to classify yourself as either a type-F person,
a type-P person, or a type-T person. (I’m this book’s author so I get to make
up some personality types. I can even point to someone in public and say,
“Look! He’s a type-T person!”)

**A type-F person** wants to see the fundamentals. (The letter F stands for
fundamentals.) “Show me a program that lays out the principles in their
barest, most basic form,” says the type-F person. A type-F person isn’t
worried about bells and whistles. The bells come later, and the whistles
may never come at all. If you’re a type-F person, you want to see a
program that uses the FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee
subclasses and then moves out of your way so you can get some
work done.

_*A type-P person*_ wants practical applications. (The letter P stands for
practical.) Type-P people need to see ideas in context; otherwise, the
ideas float away too quickly. “Show me a program that demonstrates the usefulness of the FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee
subclasses,” says the type-P person. “I have no use for your stinking
abstractions. I want real-life examples, and I want them now!”

**A type-T person** is inspired by something that I write about briefly in
Chapter 7. The T person wants to test the code in the FullTimeEmployee
and PartTimeEmployee subclasses. Testing the code means putting
the code through its paces — checking the output’s accuracy when the
input is ordinary, when the input is unexpected, and even when the
input is completely unrealistic. What’s more, the type-T person wants
to use a standard, easily recognizable outline for the testing code so
that other programmers can quickly understand the test results. The
type-T person creates JUnit tests that use the FullTimeEmployee and
PartTimeEmployee subclasses.
